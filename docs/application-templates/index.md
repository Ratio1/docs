# Application Templates

Application templates are a practical way to move from a known use case to a reproducible Ratio1 app shape.
In this chapter, templates are organized as practical starting points with separate development and deployment tracks.

## What this chapter covers

- how to pick a template by use case and operating model;
- how template pages split into `How to Develop` and `How to Deeploy`;
- how to validate deployed behavior with Ratio1 runtime surfaces.

## How to use templates effectively

1. Pick the closest template to your target use case.
2. Follow `How to Develop` to adapt code, configuration, and integration points.
3. Follow `How to Deeploy` to move from local changes to managed deployment.
4. Verify operational posture in `app.ratio1.ai` and `explorer.ratio1.ai`.

## Scope boundary

- Chapter 8 intro is orientation-only.
- Template-specific implementation/deployment details live in each template subtree.
- Production governance/economics background remains in Chapter 2 and CSP docs.
