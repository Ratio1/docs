## How the CSP model works

At a high level, the lifecycle of a CSP deployment looks like this:

1. **Onboard to Ratio1**
   - Obtain the required node licenses  
   - Run an Oracle Node  
   - Deploy your CSP escrow smart contract  

2. **Secure a client workload**
   - Agree on deployment requirements and budget  
   - Define runtime, resources, and replicas  

3. **Fund the escrow**
   - Convert the deployment budget into supported stablecoin (Base USDC) 
   - Lock funds into the CSP escrow smart contract  

4. **Deploy via Deeploy**
   - Create a project  
   - Configure jobs and tunnels  
   - Select node requirements  
   - Launch the workload  

5. **Automated execution**
   - Ratio1 distributes the workload across Edge Nodes  
   - Oracles monitor uptime and performance  
   - Nodes are replaced automatically if failures occur  

6. **Reward distribution**
   - Node operators receive PoAI rewards for completed work  
   - A protocol burn is applied automatically (15% of the onchain job price) 
   - All settlement happens transparently onchain

## Why become a Ratio1 CSP?

Operating as a CSP on Ratio1 offers several advantages:

### Infrastructure without datacenters
You do not need to purchase or manage server fleets.  
Compute capacity is provided by the global Ratio1 Edge Node network.

### Full pricing control
CSPs set their own pricing models, margins, and service bundles.  
Ratio1 does not dictate how you charge clients.
See [Ratio1 Pricing](https://ratio1.ai/pricing) for current public pricing information.

### Customer ownership
Clients belong to the CSP - not to the protocol.  
You can brand your services and build long-term relationships.

### Built-in reliability
Deployments automatically benefit from:

- multi-node redundancy  
- automatic failover  
- distributed orchestration  
- uptime monitoring via oracles
