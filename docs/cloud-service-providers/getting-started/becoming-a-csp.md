# Becoming a CSP

Anyone can become a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) on Ratio1 provided they meet the basic licensing and verification requirements and are approved by the Ratio1 team. CSPs operate deployments for clients using the Ratio1 network and gain access to the Deeploy application and CSP tooling.

## Requirements to become a CSP

To operate as a CSP you must:

- Pass required **KYC/KYB verification**
- Own at least **one Ratio1 Node Deed license**
- Run a **licensed Oracle Node**
- Deploy your **CSP escrow smart contract**

All CSP applications are subject to review and approval by the Ratio1 team.

Once approved, you will gain access to the Deeploy application and CSP tooling.

## Eligibility

Any user or organization that owns at least **one valid Ratio1 license** and successfully completes the required verification process can apply to become a CSP. Final activation is granted after manual verification by the Ratio1 team.

## How to apply

To request CSP status, send an application email to:

**contact@ratio1.ai**

## Oracle node rewards

When a node is configured as an **Oracle Node** for CSP operations, it participates in network coordination and validation.

Oracle nodes:

- receive **Proof of Availability (PoA)** rewards  
- **do not receive Proof of AI (PoAI) rewards** from job execution  

PoAI rewards are distributed only to nodes actively running deployed workloads.
