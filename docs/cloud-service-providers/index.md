description: Introduction to operating as a Cloud Service Provider on Ratio1
---

Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are operators who deploy and manage workloads for clients using the Ratio1 decentralized infrastructure.

Instead of maintaining their own datacenters, CSPs use Ratio1 to launch applications, fund deployments through escrow smart contracts, and monitor running jobs while the network handles orchestration, redundancy, and reward settlement.

This operating model can be viewed as similar to a franchise-style approach: CSPs bring their own customers, define their own service terms, and manage deployments, while Ratio1 provides the underlying distributed infrastructure and automation layer. This allows providers to offer cloud and AI services with reduced infrastructure overhead, built-in redundancy, and transparent onchain settlement, while retaining control over pricing and customer relationships.

In this section, you will learn how to become a CSP, understand the basic pricing and operating model, and use Deeploy to deploy and manage workloads on the Ratio1 network.
