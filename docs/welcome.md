# Ratio1 Docs

Welcome to the official documentation for **Ratio1.ai** - the decentralized AI
meta-operating system.

Ratio1 is designed as the _“Airbnb of idle compute for AI”_: a trustless,
blockchain-coordinated platform that transforms unused computing resources -
laptops, servers, edge devices, and cloud VMs - into a global, decentralized AI
execution fabric. Instead of relying on centralized data centers or opaque cloud
providers, Ratio1 coordinates computation through smart contracts, cryptographic
identity, and a peer-to-peer network of licensed nodes.

At its core, Ratio1 functions as an **AI operating system** for the
decentralized era. It unifies model development, deployment, orchestration, and
inference into a single protocol, abstracting away infrastructure complexity
while preserving data sovereignty, auditability, and resilience. Developers can
deploy containerized applications or AI microservices without managing servers,
schedulers, or trust assumptions - while the protocol transparently handles
coordination, verification, and incentives onchain.

By extending cloud-native concepts such as container orchestration and
serverless execution into a trustless environment, Ratio1 offers a disruptive
alternative to traditional cloud platforms. It enables lower costs, edge-first
availability, strong privacy guarantees, and new economic models for AI - where
compute providers are rewarded directly for real availability and useful work.

## What this covers

- Core concepts, architecture, and primitives of the Ratio1 protocol
- How decentralized orchestration, storage, authentication, and incentives work
  together
- Practical guidance for developers, node operators, and protocol integrators

This documentation can be read end-to-end or used as a reference. Start with the
fundamentals, then dive deeper as needed.
