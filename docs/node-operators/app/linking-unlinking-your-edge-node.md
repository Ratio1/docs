# Linking/Unlinking your Edge Node

## What this covers

- What must be ready before linking
- Why a linked license is required for network participation
- How to link a license to your node ETH address in the app
- How to unlink a node from a license in the app

## Before you link

Before linking a license, make sure you:

1. Installed and started an Edge Node.
2. Have the node's ETH address available.
3. Own a Ratio1 license in your wallet.

Install guide:

## Why linking is required

A running node is not enough by itself.  
For a node to be allowed to participate in the Ratio1 network, it must have a
License linked to its ETH address.

## Link your license to your node

1. Open `app.ratio1.ai` and connect the wallet that owns your license.
2. Go to **Licenses & Nodes**. ![Go to Licenses & Nodes](../img/6.jpg)

4. Open the license menu and select **Link**. ![Select Link](../img/7.jpg)
5. Paste the node's ETH address.

6. Confirm and sign the transaction in your wallet.

After the transaction is confirmed, that license is linked to the node address
you provided. ![Linked License](../img/10.jpg)

## Unlink your node from your license

1. Open `app.ratio1.ai` and connect the wallet that owns your license.
2. Go to **Licenses & Nodes** and find a license that already has a linked node.
3. Open the license menu and select **Unlink**.
4. Confirm unlinking.
5. Sign the transaction in your wallet.

After confirmation, the node is unlinked from that license.

:::note Cooldown after unlinking 
Once a node is unlinked, a **24-hour cooldown**
period applies before another node can be linked to that license.
