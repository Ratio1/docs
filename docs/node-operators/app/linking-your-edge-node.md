3. Own a Ratio1 license in your wallet.

## Why linking is required

A running node is not enough by itself.  
For a node to be allowed to participate in the Ratio1 network, it must have a
License linked to its ETH address.

## Link your license to your node

1. Open `app.ratio1.ai` and connect the wallet that owns your license.
2. Go to **Licenses & Nodes**.
3. Find the license you want to use.
4. Open the license menu and select **Link**.
5. Paste the node's ETH address.
6. Confirm and sign the transaction in your wallet.

After the transaction is confirmed, that license is linked to the node address
you provided.
