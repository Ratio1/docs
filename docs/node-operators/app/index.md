# Getting Started with the Node Operators App

The Node Operators App is the control center for onboarding, licensing, and
day-to-day node operations. It’s where you connect your wallet, complete
verification, purchase Node Deed licenses, link your Edge Node, and track
rewards - all from a single, protocol-native interface.

If you’re new to Ratio1, start here. This section walks you through the minimum
steps required to become an active, verified operator and begin earning on
Mainnet.
