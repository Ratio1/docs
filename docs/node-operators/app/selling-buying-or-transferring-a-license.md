# Selling, buying, or transferring a license

## What this covers

- Who can sell, buy, or transfer a license
- The two transfer methods (direct transfer or NFT marketplace sale)
- What the current owner must do before transfer
- What the new owner must complete before using the license

---

## Who can sell, buy, or transfer

- Any current license owner can transfer or sell their license.
- Any user can receive or buy a license.
- Ownership transfer is allowed both directly and via decentralized NFT
  marketplaces.

---

## How transfers work

Licenses can change ownership in two ways:

- Directly wallet-to-wallet
- Through decentralized NFT trading platforms (for example,
  [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/ratio1ai))

In both cases, the onchain owner changes to the receiving wallet.

## Before selling or transferring (current owner checklist)

Before you send a license or list it for sale:

1. Claim all pending rewards.
2. Unlink the node from the license.

:::warning Important
Always claim rewards and unlink the node before transferring ownership or listing the license on a decentralized NFT marketplace. If you don’t, the transfer transaction will fail. The listing for sale may succeed, but the purchase will not go through.

## After buying or receiving (new owner checklist)

Buying or receiving a license does not automatically activate it for protocol
use.

The new owner must still:

- Be eligible under Ratio1 compliance rules
- Complete and pass KYC/KYB

Only after eligibility checks and KYC/KYB can the new owner link the license to
a node and use it in the Ratio1 protocol.

---

## Key rule to remember

Ownership transfer is permissionless, but protocol usage is compliance-gated.
