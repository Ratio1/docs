# Buying your first Ratio1 license

## What this covers

This guide explains how to purchase your first **Ratio1 Node Deed (ND)
license**. It focuses on:

- What the **R1 token** is and why it’s required
- How to get **R1 tokens**
- How to buy a **Node Deed license** from the dashboard
- What happens after your purchase

A Node Deed license is required for an edge node to participate in the Ratio1
protocol and earn R1 rewards from **PoA (Proof of Availability - rewards for
node availability)** and **PoAI (Proof of AI - rewards for executing jobs)**.

## Understanding the R1 token

The **R1 token** is the native utility token of the Ratio1 protocol.

You must **hold R1 tokens in your Base-compatible wallet** to purchase Node Deed
licenses.

**Key facts:**

- R1 is used to purchase Node Deed licenses
- Each license has a price denominated in R1
- You need enough R1 in your wallet before initiating a purchase. It’s
  recommended to hold a small additional amount of R1 to account for slippage,
  as well as enough Base Ethereum to cover gas fees.
- License purchases are completed via onchain transactions

If your wallet does not contain sufficient R1 or Base Ethereum for gas, the
purchase cannot be completed.

2. Select your payment token
3. Choose the amount to swap
4. Sign two transactions:
   - Token approval
   - Swap confirmation

After confirmation, the R1 tokens will appear in your wallet balance.

### Option B - Buy R1 on Uniswap

You can also obtain R1 directly through the **USDC/R1 liquidity pool on
Uniswap**.

**Steps:**

1. Open the **USDC/R1 pair** on Uniswap
2. Connect your wallet
3. Enter swap amounts
4. Sign the approval and swap transactions

### Purchase steps

3. Select how many licenses you want
4. Review the total R1 cost
5. Sign two transactions:

After confirmation, your licenses will appear in the **Licenses & Nodes**
section of the app.

## After purchasing

Once purchased, your Node Deed license is stored in your wallet and is visible
in the **Licenses & Nodes** section. From this section, you can manage your
licenses and link them to your running nodes to activate them.
