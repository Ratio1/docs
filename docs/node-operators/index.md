# For Node Operators

This section is dedicated to **node operators** - individuals or organizations
who contribute computing resources to the Ratio1 network and help power its
decentralized AI infrastructure.

Operating a Ratio1 node means participating in a global, trustless compute
fabric where real AI workloads are executed across independently owned hardware.
Your machine becomes a **Ratio1 Edge Node (REN)**, securely authenticated,
licensed, and coordinated by the protocol through smart contracts and
decentralized oracles.

Unlike traditional cloud platforms, Ratio1 does not rely on centralized
schedulers, opaque billing, or discretionary control. Node operation is governed
entirely by the protocol: availability and work are continuously verified,
rewards are calculated transparently, and incentives are aligned with real
network contribution.

As a node operator, you:

- Run licensed Edge Nodes on your own hardware or cloud infrastructure
- Maintain uptime to earn **Proof-of-Availability (PoA)** rewards
- Execute AI workloads to earn **Proof-of-AI (PoAI)** fees
- Participate in a decentralized, auditable, and resilient AI network

Node operators are not anonymous workers. Ratio1 nodes are licensed,
identifiable, and accountable participants, enabling higher reliability,
stronger guarantees, and optional enterprise-grade compliance - without
sacrificing decentralization. Learn more about Ratio1’s permissioned yet
trustless approach in the
[Email registration & KYC/KYB](./app/email-registration-and-kyc-kyb) section of
the docs or in our
[Permissionless vs. Trustless article](https://ratio1.ai/blog/permissionless-vs-trustless).

:::note Important Notice About Licenses
Due to compliance with European jurisdiction, individuals and companies from
the following prohibited countries are not eligible to purchase 
Licenses or link a license to a node to join the Ratio1 protocol.

**Prohibited Countries:** Afghanistan, Barbados, Belarus, Burkina Faso,
Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cayman Islands, Central African Republic, Congo
(the Democratic Republic of), Egypt, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq,
Jamaica, Jordan, Korea (the Democratic People's Republic of), Lebanon, Libya,

If you are a resident or entity of any of the above countries, you are
prohibited from participating in the License sale or acting as a node runner
in the protocol.

If there are changes at the jurisdictional level, we will promptly update this
list to reflect the most current regulatory requirements.

This section guides you through everything required to operate nodes
effectively, from initial setup to day-to-day management.
