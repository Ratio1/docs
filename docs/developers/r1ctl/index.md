# r1ctl

`r1ctl` is the SDK-provided command-line client for network and node operations from a terminal workflow.

## What `r1ctl` is for

- network visibility (nodes, supervisors, communication relays);
- node/app inspection from your authorized client context;
- operational commands (restart/shutdown/rollout) where permitted;
- local client configuration (network, alias, address).

## Naming note

- Current package entry point is `r1ctl` (`ratio1.cli.cli:main`).
- Some older SDK text references `nepctl`; treat that as legacy naming around the same CLI module lineage.
