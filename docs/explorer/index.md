# The Explorer

The Ratio1 Explorer is a public interface for viewing live information about the
Ratio1 network. It provides transparent access to network activity, node status,
deployments, and ecosystem metrics in real time.

The Explorer is designed to help users, node operators, and Cloud Service
Providers monitor the health and activity of the network without needing direct
access to internal tools.

Go to [explorer.ratio1.ai](https://explorer.ratio1.ai/).

## What you can view

Using the Explorer, you can:

- check active nodes and their status
- view network-wide metrics and activity
- monitor deployments and workload distribution
- explore protocol statistics such as adoption levels, node distribution, and
  network geography
- inspect ecosystem statistics and operational data

## Why it matters

The Explorer improves transparency across the Ratio1 ecosystem by making network
activity publicly observable. This allows participants to independently verify
network operations, track system performance, and understand how the network is
growing and distributed globally.

Use the Explorer whenever you need a real-time overview of the network or want
to verify operational data.
